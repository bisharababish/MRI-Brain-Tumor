##### This project focuses on developing an innovative AI-integrated application designed to analyze MRI scans of the brain and accurately detect the presence of tumors. Utilizing the PyTorch framework for its machine learning model, the project employs CNNs to achieve high accuracy in image analysis tasks. This approach ensures high performance and precision, addressing a critical need in medical diagnostics.
##### The website’s main header has a hover menu with buttons for "Introduction", "How To Demo", and "About us". Each button leads to its own page that explains the website’s purpose and other details provided. For instance, the Introduction page talks about what MRI is and explains common knowledge, while the How To Demo page shows how the application works without using AI. It lets you choose a picture from a provided folder and displays information about it. The About Us page introduces the team behind this project, Bishara Babish and Saliba Rishmawi, with some general knowledge and background about them. Also, there’s a language switch button on the top right that changes the website’s language between English (EN) and Arabic (AR), and vice versa.
##### The Introduction page gives an overview of what MRI is, explaining its purpose and how it relates to our project. The main goal of the project is to use AI to identify brain tumor, specifically Meningioma, Hemangioblastoma, Medulloblastoma, Pilocytic Astrocytoma, and Central Neurocytoma, It also discusses the application we’re developing, which detects brain tumor using image recognition. Then, it introduces the two individuals behind the project, Bishara Babish and Saliba Rishmawi both computer Science students who are focusing on AI for this project. Our Hope is to contribute meaningfully to the collective efforts in the fight against brain cancer. Also, as it shows in the second picture that it is in Arabic which we use the language switch button to change the language as provided.
##### The pictures provide information about Bishara Babish and Saliba Rishmawi, covering details about their university, age, educational journey, and experiences. It also highlights the programming languages they know, their goals, and their contributions to the project. The roles they play are different, with Bishara focusing on the user interface, frontend development, and documentation, while Saliba serves as the project lead, AI researcher, and AI model developer, also handling project management and application development. This information is available in both Arabic and English. After that, it touches on their personal interests, concluding with a summary of their roles and contributions.
##### The provided section discusses the "How To Demo" demonstration, which shows how the application works without AI. It involves selecting built-in images from a dataset provided by hospitals in Palestine. In this demo, you can browse through folders, and when you click on one, it displays detailed information, as explained in Figure 7.8.
##### This section demonstrates that when you click on a folder containing the types of tumours we're working with, it shows three different images, each with distinct information and diagnoses provided by doctors in Palestine who specialize in MRI brain tumours. These doctors assisted with the diagnosis and analysis of the images. The information is displayed in both Arabic and English, as it's built into the system. There's also a "Clear" button, which removes the selected images and the related information, allowing users to reset the view.
